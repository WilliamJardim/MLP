# Description
This project is an adaptation of Jason Brownlee's original code. I really liked the way his article taught backpropagation.

I rewrote the functions in JavaScript, but using the same method used by Jason Brownlee, and I also used the same example dataset that he used in the article to test if my adaptation follows the steps correctly. I also used the original files to do tests.

Also, the "examples" folder contains 1 example used in Jason Brownlee's article, I used it to test if my code worked

**I also left a copy of the original file in a folder called "original_code"**

Thank you, Jason! I'm grateful for having the opportunity to write an adaptation of your code, which was very good for my learning!
